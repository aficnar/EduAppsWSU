# EduAppsWSU

A sampl of educational apps I coded for World Science U

* I have devised and coded some of the interactive simulations to illustrate physical concepts 
for Prof. Brian Greeneâ€™s courses on [World Science U](http://www.worldscienceu.com/), 
a new platform for online education with more than 100,000 registrants.

* The simulations have been coded in Mathematica to be standalone applications, where users can 
manipulate content using standard tools like buttons and sliders, in a user-friendly way. The apps
have been embedded in the website using Wolfram's CDF format.
